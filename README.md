# Discussion: Internal

Discussion related to course matters will be held in [the Issues](https://github.com/IDPT7801/Discussion/issues) of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. 

Use this to discuss course-specific things. Examples of discussion topics:

- Office hours
- Assignment clarifications
- Class meetings
- Help with coding problems
- Installation issues
- Other types of computational problems

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.
